This Local Pairwise Alignment Dynamic Programming Matrix was created by Nathaniel Gauvin.

The "sequences" fields require you to input sequences in all caps, as this is the proper notation for amino acid sequences.
The program will allow you to select scoring values 0-10 to allow for other methods of scoring dynamic programming matrices to be used.
